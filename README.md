# Reffind Dev Test

This is a simple one page application coded in angularjs with the backend powered by ruby on rails. The app takes a string entered by a user then connects to the Flickr API.

# Specifications

- rails 4.2.6
- angularjs

# Steps upon cloning

1. bundle install
2. rake db:create
3. Enter a string to search for photos in Flickr!

# Improvements

- loading images is slow.
